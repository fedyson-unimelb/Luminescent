# RPM Hire – AI-Driven Asset Optimisation by Luminescent
# Sisi Dai | Lisha Yue | Franklin Edyson | Wenqi Zhang

##  Problem  
- Equipment batteries degrade faster than expected → premature replacement → higher costs.  
- Idle assets & lumpy demand → poor utilisation, ROI delayed (1–2 years per unit).  
- Inefficient redeployment → excess km, driver hours, fuel cost, emissions.  
- Limited visibility for staff → imprecise decision-making.

1. **Battery Health (Telematics)**  
   - Detect degradation trends (voltage decline over time).  
   - Predict failures before they occur → schedule replacements only when needed.  

2. **Quotes & Demand Forecasting**  
   - Analyse quotes to predict demand spikes by location, time, and asset type.  
   - Forecast demand 2+ weeks ahead to pre-position equipment in the right depots.  

3. **Transport Optimisation**  
   - Use GPS + asset location data for route clustering.  
   - Solve Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) to minimise total km driven.  
   - Estimate CO₂ savings via reduced km × fuel efficiency.

## Key Takeaways from Data Analysis
![Alt text](https://res.cloudinary.com/dxkdexo4w/image/upload/v1759204829/wenqi/luminon/output_aw9xwd.png)
- **Battery telemetry**:  
  - Avg. 11.43V (healthy ~12V).  
  - 44% readings below warning (11.5V).  
  - 7% readings in critical risk zone (<11.0V).  

- **Quotes data**:  
  - 2,700+ entries, mostly VIC ELECTRONICS depot.  
  - Most requested: Concrete Barriers (786), Transportation (709), Amber VMS (112).  
  - Median daily hire ~$27.50; outliers up to $43k.  
  - Weekly demand is volatile → strong seasonality.  

- **Transport & Drivers**:  
  - 10 Melbourne drivers handle redeployments.  
  - AI-driven clustering could reduce redundant trips by **15–25%**, saving fuel & emissions.

**Phase 1 – Proof of Concept (0–3 months)**  
- Clean GPS + asset data.  
- Pilot predictive battery model.  
- Build basic dashboard (health + redeployment recs).  

**Phase 2 – Optimisation (6–12 months)**  
- Add demand forecasting model.  
- Integrate AI into driver scheduling.  
- Deliver UI with map-based optimisation.  
- Organise staff training with innovative engagement such as gamification.

**Phase 3 – Scale (12–24 months)**  
- Roll out across full fleet (120+ assets, national).  
- AI-assisted procurement & retirement decisions.  
- Sustainability reporting (CO₂ saved, utilisation %).
