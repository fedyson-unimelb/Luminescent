a) Battery Voltage (Telematics health data)
Trend detection: Show how equipment (like traffic lights/signage) degrade over time (your chart already shows steady decline).
Predictive maintenance: Build a simple ML regression model to predict when a battery will fall below safe threshold → replace/rotate before failure → extend equipment life.
Story for COO: “Instead of replacing batteries every X months, we can predict exactly when each one will need service, cutting costs and extending lifespan.”

b) Quotes & Demand Forecasting
Analyse quotes.csv for:
Demand spikes (which day of week, which locations get most requests).
Quote-to-conversion ratio (predict where assets will actually be deployed).
Feed this into an AI model to forecast asset demand by region/project type.
nearly half of the time the battery is already under stress, and 7% of the time it’s at risk of complete failure.

“We can predict that signage boards will be needed in outer Melbourne 2 weeks before tenders hit, and pre-position assets accordingly.”

Problem: Equipment batteries are degrading faster than expected → risk of premature replacement → higher costs.
Solution with AI: Predict when each battery will fall below safe thresholds → schedule replacements only when needed → extend asset lifespan.
Impact:
Reduce unnecessary battery swaps.
Improve uptime and reliability (better customer satisfaction).
Lower waste: sustainability edge in government tenders.
Depot activity:
Almost all requests logged under VIC ELECTRONICS (2773 entries) → strong Melbourne base, great starting point for pilot.
Most common asset types requested:
Concrete Barrier Install – 786
Transportation services – 709
Insurance Charges – 186
Consumables – 118
Amber VMS (Variable Message Sign) – 112
Hire rates (daily):
Median daily hire ~ $27.50
Typical upper range $50
Outliers exist (up to $43k, likely bulk transport or bundled contracts).
Demand trends (weekly):
Quotes vary widely week to week (e.g. 137 in early Sept vs only 20 by late Sept).
Indicates high seasonality & project-based demand → perfect scenario for AI-based prediction.

c) Transport Optimisation (Drivers + Assets)
Use GPS coordinates + asset locations (once available) to run:
Route clustering → assign jobs to drivers closest to assets.
VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem) optimisation → minimise total km.
Estimate CO₂ savings = reduced km × fuel efficiency.
Story for COO: “10 drivers in Melbourne currently handle redeployments. With AI-driven clustering, we can cut redundant trips by 15–25%, saving thousands in fuel and reducing emissions.”
3.  Implementation Roadmap (pitch-ready)
Phase 1 – Proof of Concept (3 months)
Clean existing GPS + asset data.
Pilot predictive battery health model.
Build a basic dashboard (asset health + redeployment recommendations).
Phase 2 – Optimisation (6–12 months)
Add AI demand forecasting for assets.
Integrate with driver scheduling.
Provide UI with map-based optimisation.
Phase 3 – Scale (12–24 months)
Roll out across national fleet (120 assets, multiple states).
AI-assisted procurement & retirement decisions.
Full sustainability reporting (CO₂ saved, utilisation %).

How?
Financial: Prevent asset failures, cut fuel costs, extend asset ROI (currently takes ~1–2 yrs to pay off per unit).
Sustainability: Strengthens tender applications (government loves SDG-linked vendors).
Innovation: AI brand advantage (position as niche market leader in smart traffic equipment).




demand is lumpy and unpredictable → inefficient redeployment → idle assets + unnecessary transport.
AI Opportunity:
Forecast demand by asset type & region.
Pre-position equipment at depots near predicted hotspots.
Optimise driver routing to reduce km travelled.
Impact:
Better asset utilisation (assets pay off in 1–2 yrs → faster ROI).
Cut fuel & driver costs (less empty runs).
Support SDGs (9, 11, 12, 13) with sustainable logistics.
